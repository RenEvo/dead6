# Overview #
The Purchase System manages all the purchase entries for the teams and controls the server/client communication for getting menu updates and making/confirming purchases.

Purchasing holds vital importance in Command & Conquer Mode. It allows a player to upgrade their character class, obtain new weapons, vehicles and items, and replenish their ammo and health counts. The contents are updated on the server and can be changed based on the status of buildings during the game. Clients can request the contents of the purchase menu and make purchases which are approved and handled by the server.
