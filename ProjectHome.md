**Command & Crysis: The Dead 6**

The Dead 6 is an interactive extension of the Command & Conquer franchise.  From the battlefield perspective you will get to experience, and change the fate of C&C as you know it.

In the single player campaign you will play each member of The Dead 6 on their final “death” missions which take place all over the world in “close to factual” theaters of war.  Once completing the 6 members of the team, you will push the team into overdrive and enter into leading the 6 character team from any perspective.  The possibilities and choices are almost limitless on how you can approach these campaigns.

Ever wonder what happened between Red Alert and Tiberium Dawn?

Still breaking you head on how the “bad” guys have a mammoth, then later the “good” guys have it?
