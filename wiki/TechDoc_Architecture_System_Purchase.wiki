#summary System Feature - Purchase System

= Overview =
The Purchase System manages all the purchase systems and handles player and logic communication between making purchases and altering the attributes of each purchasable item

Purchasing holds vital importance in Command & Conquer Mode. It allows a player to upgrade their character class, obtain new weapons, vehicles and items, and replenish their ammo and health counts. Loosely, the contents in the purchase menu are filled when the level is loaded, but can be added to manually during the duration of the game. The contents are updated on the server and can be changed based on the status of buildings during the game. Clients can request the contents of the purchase menu and make purchases which are approved and handled by the server.
