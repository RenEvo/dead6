#summary System Feature - Team Manager

= Overview =
The Team Manager module is responsible for managing the defined teams. Teams are defined per level, with a Lua script and XML file that define the team's attributes and behavior. Each team is given a unique identifier ID that is used in conjunction with the Base Management code, as well as the game logic including damage rules and purchase rules.

The current team management code present in the Crysis codebase is stripped out and migrated into the Team Manager module. As such, some functionality present in the module is there for backwards compatibility.
