#summary System Feature - Vehicle Movement - Harvester

= Overview =

This Vehicle Movement class is utilized _Harvester_-type vehicles. It derives from the *StdWheeled* movement class and uses the same format for its movement properties. Essentially, all this class does is clone the standard wheel movements and removes the logic that requires a driver entity be present for the vehicle's engine to turn on and process AI movement requests.

= Notes =
When defining the vehicle entity to be used for the Harvester, you should not define any seats. If you do and a player jumps in to the "driver" seat of the Harvester, it may interfere with the flow logic assigned to the Harvester, causing unforeseen errors and a disruption to the Harvester flow.
