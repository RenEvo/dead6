#summary Dead 6 Core Technology - Coding Standards - Variable Name/Prefix Convention

== Naming Convention ==

All variable names will abide to the Hungarian notation standards. The following formula should be applied when naming all classes/structures/variables:

Variable name = a_bC where
 * a = Scope.  If local, not needed.  Otherwise use 'm' for member variables and 'g' for global variables.
 * b = Type.  See chart below.
 * C = Name of the variable.  This should be specific enough to know what the variable does or is used for.  Capital letters are used to break up words i.e. _ThisIsMyVariable_.

== Prefix Convention ==

Variables should be named by the type of data they store and not their location. For example:
{{{
int *m_pVar = &nVal; // A member variable that is a pointer to a local integer.
int *pVar = &m_nVal; // A local variable that is a pointer to a member integer.
int nVar = 5;        // A local integer variable.
}}}

The table below describes the prefix characters used for the given data types/scopes:

*Variable Types*
 || char || c || 
 || unsigned char || uc || 
 || short || s || 
 || unsigned short || us || 
 || int || n || 
 || unsigned int || ui || 
 || float || f || 
 || double || d || 
 || pointer || p... || 
 || long || l... || 
	
*Object Types*
 || Class Name || C... || 
 || Interface Name || I... ||
 || Struct Name || t... || 
 || Member Variable || m_... || 
 || Global Variable || g_... ||
