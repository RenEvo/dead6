#summary Game Feature - CNC Teams

= Overview =
Teams are handled with special care in Command & Conquer Mode game rules. A team runs as much more than an integer value attached to all players and buildings. Instead, teams have their own virtual identity running along side the game, with defined attributes and special scripts used to handle team behavior. Each team has its own XML file which identifies that team and sets its Purchase Menu content. Each team also has a Lua script that handles team behavior.


= Team XML File =
The Team XML file is the blueprint for a team. It defines the team's attributes and is the lookup book used by the Dead 6 Core to create the team at the beginning. Loaded from the map's [TechDoc_Architecture_Game_CNCRules CNCRules.xml] file, the team's XML file is located in the Teams\XML folder. (Game\Scripts\Teams\XML)

This file is only utilized if the team is defined in element (non-inline) form in the CNCRules.xml fil.

== Sample XML File ==
This is an example of a typical team XML file:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Team Name="GDI" LongName="Global Defense Initiative" Script="CNCTeam.lua" IsPlayerTeam="1">
  <Harvester Entity="Harvester" Capacity="300.0" BuildTime="10.0" LoadRate="10.0" UnloadRate="20.0" />
</Team>
}}}

The Team tag's attributes are as such:
 * Name - The short-hand name of the team.
 * !LongName - The long-hand name of the team.
 * Script - The Lua script inherited and used by this team for team behavior controlling.
 * IsPlayerTeam - Boolean flag used to determine if a player can join this team or not.

The contained Harvester tag is used to define the Team's Harvester properties, which are inherited by all Harvesters created on the team. It's attributes are defined as such:
 * Entity - The entity to use for the Harvester
 * Capacity - How much tiberium the Harvester can hold in its tank
 * !BuildTime - How long it takes the Harvester to be rebuilt once destroyed, in seconds
 * !LoadRate - How long it takes the Harvester to load its tank with tiberium, in one part of tiberium per second. (A capacity of 300 with a load rate of 1 would take 300 seconds to fully load)
 * !UnloadRate - How long it takes the Harvester to unload its tank, in one part of tiberium per second.


= Team LUA File =
Each team has the ability to run a Lua script along side it to handle team behaviors. Special callbacks are made to it to control when players join/leave the team, when team members speak in public chat, when team-controlled buildings, vehicles and soldiers are damaged and killed, etc.

== Script Functionality ==
All callbacks have a separate server and client path that are called on the server and local client's ends, respectively.
