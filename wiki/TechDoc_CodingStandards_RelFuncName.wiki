#summary Dead 6 Core Technology - Coding Standards - Relevant Function Names

Functions should be named logically in such a way that anybody working with and/or reading the code can easily distinguish the function's purpose completely by the name alone. There is no limit to the length of a function's name; however, lengthy names are frowned upon. Keep it concise and simple. Separations of words in the name are noted with capital letters i.e. the function named _"This is a function"_ is read as _"ThisIsAFunction."_ No prefixes are applied to function names.
