# Overview #

The Power Plant derives from [CNC Building](TechDoc_Architecture_Game_Buildings_CNCBuilding.md) and has the functionality to enable power for all other buildings belonging to the team while it is alive with power. When it goes underpowered or is destroyed, it also causes all other buildings belonging to the team to go underpowered.
